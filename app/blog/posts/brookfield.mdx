During a Sitecore web refresh project, Austin was fully embedded in the development workflow, attending over 80 daily Scrum calls to stay aligned with shifting priorities and team goals. He also participated in weekly code reviews, gaining insight into development standards and collaborative problem-solving within a professional engineering environment.

In his hands-on role, Austin contributed to QA testing through the Sitecore CMS, helping identify and resolve issues before deployment. He also implemented frontend features using raw JavaScript, improving site performance and contributing to a smoother user experience.

His work supported more than five successful deployments, each benefiting from reduced bugs and cleaner functionalityâ€”reinforcing his commitment to quality and attention to detail throughout the development cycle.
