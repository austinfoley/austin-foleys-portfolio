            Austin (and his girlfriend Grace) decided after completing their respective bootcamps in UX / UI
            and web developemnt, that they could improve beyond their cirriculum and come together to make a 
            fullstack application. They both share a love for coffee and friends, and together have been making
            a custom home cafe application for hosts and friends to enjoy!

          <h3 className="mb-2.5 font-bold tracking-tight">Created with React Native</h3>
          <br></br>
          <p>

            To be able to eventually deploy this app on mobile as well as websites, and to get some great practice
            with script running for specific formats, Austin and Grace decided to work on React Native, where Austin would 
            set up the frontend to be compatible with different assets.

          <h3 className="mb-2.5 font-bold tracking-tight">UX/UI Collaboration</h3>
          <br></br>
          <p>

            Austin and Grace worked back and forth on planning, creating, and implementing the UI of
            the coffee app, going into detail on best practices for user experience, a general
            aesthetic / design to adhere to, and how to manage expectations of design while creating
            a practical architecure for the application.

          <h3 className="mb-2.5 font-bold tracking-tight">Using Java to Collect Coffee Orders</h3>
          <br></br>
          <p>

            For Austin, thanks to his background in Java from the Caltech Coding Bootcamp, he was able to design a 
            structural backend to be able to collect order information and send it to a database to be able to organize and
            process orders.
