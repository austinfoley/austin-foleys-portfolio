          <p>
            During a Sitecore web refresh project, Austin was fully embedded in the development workflow, 
            attending daily Scrum calls over a 4 month period of time to stay aligned with shifting priorities 
            and team goals. He also participated in weekly code reviews, gaining insight into development 
            standards and collaborative problem-solving within a professional engineering environment.

          <h3 className="mb-2.5 font-bold tracking-tight">Development QA</h3>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            In his hands-on role, Austin contributed to QA testing with Jira, 
            helping identify and resolve issues before deployment. These QA Jira tasks would include 
            verifying functionality of single components of a webpage, loading the webpage on different
            browsers and operating systems with BrowserStack, and writing bug tickets where applicable
            with explanations of bug replication.

          <h3 className="mb-2.5 font-bold tracking-tight">Use of Sitecore</h3>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Austin became familiar with Sitecore to edit content for testing and publishing purposes,
            included noting changes between different builds of Brookfield page, versioning content for
            testing purposes, and pushing changes on dev to make sure Sitecore CMS handled correctly.

          <h3 className="mb-2.5 font-bold tracking-tight">Frontend Development</h3>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Austin additionally had hands on experience with Umbraco, where smaller Brookfield websites
            have their frontend located. He helped implement CSS changes and find and clone frontend files locally to 
            preserve and update proper changes.
