          <br></br>
          <p>
            Beginning your web development career naturally requires designing and deploying an online portfolio,
            making sure everything works according to plan. This website has been an ongoing project for Austin while 
            keeping his abilities in the NextJS framework as fresh as possible!

          <h3 className="mb-2.5 font-bold tracking-tight">Created with NextJS</h3>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Austin built this portfolio using Next.js, leveraging its App Router for structured routing
             and fast performance. He used MDX for dynamic blog content and static generation to improve 
             SEO and load times. The site reflects modern web standards with responsive design, dark mode,
             and modular components.

          <h3 className="mb-2.5 font-bold tracking-tight">Deployed Through Vercel</h3>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Austin managed project dependencies to ensure all packages functioned correctly throughout development.
             He created production builds using Node.js to optimize the application for deployment. Updates were 
             version-controlled with GitHub, triggering seamless deployments through Vercel.
